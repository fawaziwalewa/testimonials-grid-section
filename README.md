## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

---

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of **CSS Grid** and how to structure layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I also practiced using **box shadows** and aligning components with **Flexbox** for individual card elements.

Here's an example of how I utilized CSS Grid for the layout:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 24px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Improving accessibility through ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
- Experimenting with more advanced **CSS Grid** techniques.
- Ensuring better browser compatibility for responsive designs.
